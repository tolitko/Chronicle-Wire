Wire Format abstraction library
===
*Note that version chronicle-wire-1.0.10-alpha  is the last official version released under the apache license.


# Purpose

Chronicle Wire supports a separation of describing what data you want to store and retrieve
   and how it should be rendered/parsed.
   Wire handles a variety of formatting options for a wide range of formats.

A key aim of Wire is to support schema changes.  It should make reasonable 
    attempts to handle
* optional fields
* fields in a different order.
* fields the consumer doesn't expect. Optionally parsing them or ignoring them.
* more or less data than expected (in field-less formats) 
* reading a different type to the one written
* updating fixed length fields, atomically where possible via a "bound" data structure..

It should also be as efficient as possible in the case where any or all of these are true
* fields are in the order expected.
* fields are the type expected.
* fields names/numbers are not used.
* self describing types are not needed.
* random access of data values is supported.

Wire is designed to make it easy to convert from one wire format to another. 
  e.g. you can use fixed width binary data in memory for performance and variable width or text over the network.
  Different TCP connection could use different formats.
  
Wire also support hybrid wire formats.  e.g. you can have one format embedded in another.

# Support
This library will require Java 8. Support for C++ and C\# planned.

# Text Formats

The text formats include
* YAML (a subset of mapping structures included)
* JSON (planned)
* XML (planned)
* FIX (proposed)

Options include
* field names (e.g. JSON) or field numbers (e.g. FIX)
* optional fields with a default values can be dropped.
* zero copy access to fields. (planned)
* thread safe operations in text. (planned)

To support wire format discovery, the first byte should be in the ASCII range,
    adding an ASCII whitespace if needed.
    
# Binary Formats

The binary formats include
* Binary YAML
* typed data without fields.
* raw untyped fieldless data
* BSON (Binary JSon) (planned)

Options for Binary format
* field names or field numbers
* variable width
* optional fields with a default value can be dropped.
* fixed width data with zero copy support.
* thread safe operations.

Note: Wire supports debug/transparent combinations like self describing data with zero copy support.

To support wire format discovery, the first bytes should have the top bit set.

# Binding to a field value

While serialized data can be updated by replacing a whole record, this might not be the most efficient option, nor thread safe. Wire offers the ability to bind a reference to a fixed value of a field and perform atomic operations on that field such as volatile read/write and compare-and-swap.

``` java
   // field to cache the location and object used to reference a field.
   private LongValueReference counter = null;
    
   // find the field and bind an approritae wrapper for the wire format.
   wire.read(COUNTER).int64(counter, x -> counter = x);
    
   // thread safe across processes on the same machine.
   long id = counter.getAndAdd(1);
   
``` 
Other types such as 32 bit integer values and an array of 64-bit integer values are supported.
    
# Compression Options

* no compression
* Snappy compression (planned)
* LZW compression (planned)

# Bytes options

Wire is built on top of the Bytes library, however Bytes in turn can wrap

* ByteBuffer - heap and direct
* byte\[\] (via ByteBuffer)
* raw memory addresses.

# Uses

Wire will be used for

* file headers
* TCP connection headers where the optimal Wire format actually used can be negotiated.
* message/excerpt contents.
* the next version of Chronicle Queue
* the API for marshalling generated data types.

## SBE

Simple Binary Encoding is designed to do what it says.
    It's simple, it's binary and it supports C++ and Java.  It is 
    designed to be more efficient replacement for FIX. It is not limited to FIX 
    protocols and can be easily extended by updating an XML schema.
    
XML when it first started didn't use XML for it's own schema files, and it not
   insignificant that SBE doesn't use SBE for it's schema either.  This is because it is
   not trying to be human readable, it has XML which though standard isn't designed
   to be particularly human readable either.  Peter Lawrey thinks it's a limitation that it doesn't
   naturally lend itself to a human readable form.
   
The encoding SBE uses is similar to binary with field numbers and fixed width types.  
   SBE assumes the field types which can be more compact than Wire's most similar option 
   (though not as compact as others)
   
SBE has support for schema changes provided the type of a field doesn't change.
   
## msgpack

Message Pack is a packed binary wire format which also supports JSON for 
    human readability and compatibility. It has many similarities to the binary 
    (and JSON) formats of this library.  c.f. Wire is designed to be human readable first, 
    based on YAML, and has a range of options to make it more efficient, 
    the most extreme being fixed position binary.
    
 Msgpack has support for embedded binary, whereas Wire has support for
    comments and hints to improve rendering for human consumption.
    
The documentation looks well thought out, and it is worth emulating.

Note: It not clear what padding which doesn't take up space on the wire means.

# Design notes

See https://capnproto.org/news/2014-06-17-capnproto-flatbuffers-sbe.html for a comparison to other encoders.

## Schema evolution.

Wire optionally supports;
- field name changes
- field order changes.
- capturing or ignoring unexpected fields.
- setting of fields to the default if not available.
- raw messages can be longer or short than expected.

The more flexibility, the large the overhead in term of CPU and memory.  
WIre allows you to dynamically pick the optimal configuration and convert between these options.

## Zero copy
Wire supports zero copy random access to fields and direct copy from in memory to the network.
It also support translation from one wire format to another e.g. switching between fixed length data and variable length data.

## Random Access.
You can access a random field in memory
   e.g. in 2 TB file, page in/pull into CPU cache, only the data relating to you read or write.
   
| format | access style |
|----------|------------------|
| fixed length binary | random access without parsing first |
| variable length binary | random access with partial parsing. i.e. you can skip large portions |
| fixed length text | random access with parsing |
| variable length text | no random access |

Wire References are relative to the start of the data contained to allow loading in an arbitrary point in memory.

## Safe against malicious input
Wire has built in tiers of bounds checks to prevent accidental read/writing corrupting the data. 
   It is not complete enough for a security review.
   
## Reflection / generic algorithms
Wire support generic reading and writing of an arbitrary stream. This can be used in combination with predetermined fields.
   e.g. you can read the fields you know about and asked it to provide the fields you didn't.
   You can also give generic field names like keys to a map as YAML does.

##  Initialization order
 Wire can handle unknown information like lengths by using padding.  
    It will go back and fill in any data which it wasn't aware of as it was writing the data.
    e.g. when it writes an object it doesn't know how long it is going to be so it add padding at the start.  
    Once the object has been written it goes back and overwrites the length. 
    It can also hand cases where the length was more than needed known as packing.

## Unknown field retention?
Wire can handle reading data it didn't expect interspersed with data it did expect. 
   Rather than specify the expected field name, a StringBuilder is provided.

Note: there are times when you want to skip/copy an entire field or message without reading any more of it.  This is also supported.

## Object-maximumLimit RPC system.
Wire supports references based on a name, number or UUID.  
   This is useful when including a reference to an object the reader should lookup via another means.
   
A common case if when you have a proxy to a remote object and you want to pass or return this in an RPC call.

## Schema language
Wire's schema is not externalised from the code, however it is planned to use YAML in a format it can parse.

## Usable as mutable state
Wire supports storing an applications internal state. 
    This will not allow it to grow or shrink. You can't free any of it without copying 
    the pieces you need and discarding the original copy.
    
## Padding takes space on the wire.
The Wire format chosen determines if there is any padding on the wire. 
    If you copy the in memory data directly it's format doesn't change. 
    If you want to drop padding you can copy the message to a wire format without padding.
    You can decide whether the original padding is to be preserved or not if turned back into a format with padding.

We could look at supporting Cap'n'Proto's zero byte removal compression.

## Unset fields take space on the wire?
Wire supports fields with and without optional fields and automatic means of removing them.  
    It doesn't support automatically adding them back in as information has been lost.

## Pointers take space on the wire.
Wire doesn't have pointer but it does have content lengths which are 
   a useful hint for random access and robustness, but these are optional.

##  Platform support
Wire is Java 8 only for now.  Future version may support Java 6, C++ and C\#
